# Coins App


## Good practices implemented
- Folder structure prepared for expantion (clientsApi, constants, components, pages)
- Use of constant file for urls prepared for expantion
- Handling Enter key press when making request in order to prevent API client from struggling
- Array and object desctructuring 
- Use of dependency on Coin page's useEffect of searchText to reload coin information in case of surfing on same page with different parameters
- Routing to navigate to different pages


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
